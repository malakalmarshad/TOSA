# Learnable Positional Encoding for Transformers-Based Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection
This repository contains the source code related to our paper "Transformer-based Deep Learning Approach for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection Using Single-lead ECG", authored by Malak Abdullah Almarshad, Saad Al-Ahmadi, Md Saiful Islam, Adel Soudani, Ahmed S BaHammam.  The code is designed to run on TensorFlow 2.10, exploiting GPUs.

The used dataset is OSASUD and can be downloaded from: https://figshare.com/collections/A_dataset_of_stroke_unit_recordings_for_the_detection_of_Obstructive_Sleep_Apnea_Syndrome/5630890
